QUESTIONS FOR WHOEVER DECIDES TO LOOK AT THIS AND IS FEELING GENEROUS ENOUGH TO TELL ME HOW I F*CKED UP
==========================================================================================

Notes before you look:
	-Icons aren't circle icons rn, literally just got sprite and cut it to image size and and trying to just get it to show up, don't care about neatness
		>I made a new project and tried only 1 icon this time, I had all the other sizes previously but I commented them out just to see if I can manage 1
		>1 time i got it able to make the "?" go away on the leader screen but nothing was there (maybe because I had way too big of an image back then--forgot to crop to 45x45 before export--and it just empty space i saw)
		>Have not been able to recreate that EXCEPT when i tried to use "Aztec45" as an icon in the MTR_Icons.xlp through asset editor and set index to "1" on the MTR_Sacae_Icons.xml and then it showed up as *France's* solid white icon (bug????) and an index of 0 has it back to a "?"
	-The leader portion is empty af and just bare minimum (to my knowledge) to get an entry for a leader on the player selection screen


1. I want to make the civilization and leader standalone mods (i.e. how civitas does it, so multiple leaders can be under the same civ)
	>The league of Legends civs dont do this and as such theres two different civpedia entries for "Ionia" when you have both the mods

	-	However my question is, I don't see where I define the icon for the *CIV*, I've only noticed a clear definition in the leader "Config" xmls of mods I've looked at.
		So how exactly does the one icon get tied to the civ (the colored circle one you see on leader select)? And what have I done wrong? Can I even define the civ icon without the leader? (I assume so but I can't see how)

2. Are Icons (ICON_) tied to the Leader like "LOC_" text for civpedia entries works (where its kinda iffy how it's defined, the game just knows to look for it // Also a point of confusion i have)

3. If i use a temporary Icon like I am for testing rn, can it even show up? does it have to be a pixel perfect replication of the circle icons that are in the base game and thats why it's still a "?", because the game just doesn't accept it?

4. These other Icon sizes (_256, _128), how exactly does the game know which to use? Is it by the name like "LOC_" works? Can i name it a jarble of letters and it still work? (Not going to, just want to know if I need to know an exact convention)
