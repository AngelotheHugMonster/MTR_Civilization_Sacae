MOD PLAN - Lyndis from Fire Emblem (Art from FE Heroes - Legendary Lyn)
==========================================================================================
Had similar idea with horse archer to a lyn mod made for Civ 5, decided to adopt some of the other ideas

Civilization (Sacae)
	
	UI: Nomad Camp
		+1 Food +1 Culture +1 Production
		>+ [] with CIVIC
		>+ [] with CIVIC
		Effect:
			>Pastures around it get +1 Food
			>+10% border growth for each one worked in a city
		Restrictions:
			>Cannot be touching another Nomad Camp
			>Only can be built on Plains (Flat)

	UU: Nomadic Archer
		Basically Saka Horse Archer but a bit more expensive and stronger to make up 
		for the fact that unlike Scythia, you don't get two when you make em
		
		Tech:				Horseback Riding
		Production Cost:	120 (from 100)
		Gold Cost:			400
		Melee:				20 (from 15)
		Ranged:				30 (from 25)
		Atk Range:			1
		Movement:			4
		Maintenance:		2

		Bonus to damage dealt to units standing on flat terrain

	UA: Call of the Wind
		Cavalry units (Light and Heavy) Heal from moving
		NOTE: HOW THIS'LL WORK IDK, flat per tile?  

Leader (Lyn)

	UA: Lady of the Wind
		1) +1 Food and +1 Culture in a city for every 3-4 plain tiles (flat, maybe hills) 
		   OWNED in a city, not worked
		2) Every tile gained through expansion (natural or purchased) grants 10 flat 
		   production to whatever that city is working on, Buffed to 20 for Plains (maybe hills too)
