MOD PLAN - Lyndis from Fire Emblem (Art from FE Heroes - Legendary Lyn)
==========================================================================================
Had similar idea with horse archer to a lyn mod made for Civ 5, decided to adopt some of the other ideas

Civilization (Sacae)
	
	UI: Nomad Camp
		+1 Food +1 Culture +1 Production
			[*]	> +1 Food for each adjacent pasture
			[*]	> +1 Culture for every 2 adjacent plains
			[*]	> +1 Culture for every 2 adjacent plains hills
			[*] > +3 Culture with CIVIC_MEDIEVAL_FAIRES
		Effect:
			[-] > Pastures around it get +1 Food [MODIFIED]
				+ 1 food to camp for each adjacent pasture, +1 culture for every 2 adjacent plains or plains hills
			[-] > +10% border growth for each one worked in a city [CUT]
		Restrictions:
			[*] > Cannot be touching another Nomad Camp
			[*] > Only can be built on Plains (Flat)

	UU: Nomadic Archer
		Basically Saka Horse Archer but a bit more expensive and stronger to make up 
		for the fact that unlike Scythia, you don't get two when you make em
		
		Civic:				Feudalism
		Production Cost:	120 (from 100)
		Gold Cost:			400
		Melee:				28	(from 15)
		Ranged:				38	(from 25)
		Atk Range:			1
		Movement:			3	(from 4, Ability gives +1 if starting on flat terrain)
		Resource Cost:		15
		Maintenance:		2

		Bonus to damage dealt to units standing on flat terrain

	UA: Call of the Wind
		Cavalry units (Light Heavy and Ranged) Heal from moving  

Leader (Lyn)

	UA: Lady of the Wind
		1) +1 Food and +1 Culture in a city for every 3-4 plain tiles (flat, maybe hills) 
		   OWNED in a city, not worked
		2) Every tile gained through expansion (natural or purchased) grants 10 flat 
		   production to whatever that city is working on, Buffed to 20 for Plains (maybe hills too)
